# ferris-sweep-gui

This project is made for me as part of training python skills and to make a gui for Ferris Sweep GUI.
This app will show Ferris Sweep keyboard layout.
It will track which keys are pressed.
Main goal is to help me transition from a regular 65% keyboard to 34 key keyboard with layouts.
Being able to see actual layer should help in adjustment period.

My goal is to make:
- keyboard layout with keys (space, backspace etc.),
- keyboard layout will swich between layers,
- keyboard layout will be automatically copied from a ZMK config file (here cradio.config),
- app will listen for keys being pressed,
- keys will change color and thickness when pressed.

Right now v 1.0:
- keyboard layout is shown - without keys,
- working on automated ZMK config read instructions,
- app listens for keys which are being pressed and released.
